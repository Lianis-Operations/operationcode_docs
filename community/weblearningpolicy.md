# Web Based Learning Scholarships Policy

## Rules for keeping a web based learning scholarship active.

* Accounts are limited, recipients should actively be using them.
* Recipients will have 7 days to approve invitation/access their scholarship account.
* After 30 days of inactivity an account will be deactivated.
* Users will only be allowed one active web-based learning account at a time.
* Users will also be required to fill out a monthly survey telling us a bit about what they've learned over the past month. The form can be found at https://forms.gle/sX62qDzyjpoAvzFD7  or at the #digital-scholarships channel, and it is due the last day of every month. Failure to complete the form will result in the users account being deactivated.
* Users can be reactivated but without a valid reason for the deactivation will be put at the bottom of the waitlist (if applicable.)
* If a user has a valid reason or communicated that they were going to be inactive for more than 60 days prior, they will be put at the top of the waitlist and given the next available license.
* If users get banned 3 times out of any scholarship without valid reasons, they will be unable to reapply. 
* Please send us a Slack message @scholarships-team or an email at staff@operationcode.org if a situation arises.
