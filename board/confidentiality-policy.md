Operation Code

Policy Category: Governance
Policy: Confidentiality Policy
Adoption Date: December 6, 2018 (at Board meeting)
Review Date: Annual
Applies to: Board, CEO and Staff, Mentors & Mentees, Scholarship Program Volunteers, and Chapter Volunteers

Purpose
As a matter of ethics and law, Operation Code is committed to protecting the confidential
information it collects in the course of operations, and expects all associated with Operation
Code to adhere to this policy.This is a basic component of business ethics.

Policy
1. Maintaining Confidentiality: Operation Code expects its board members, volunteers,
members and staff to maintain confidentiality and to respect a) the privacy of our
volunteers, members and donors; and b) to protect Operation Code’s business data.
All financial and personal information concerning members, former members, staff,
volunteers and donors, as well as Operation Code’s business operations, is considered
to be confidential.
No information reasonably expected to be private may be released without appropriate
authorization from Operation Code senior managers and/or (if relevant) the individual or
organizations involved.
2. Definition: “Confidential” means that you are free to talk about Operation Code and
about your program and your position, but that you are not permitted to disclose
individual personal information or discuss such information in ways that will make their
identity known; nor are you permitted to reveal Operation Code’s mission-critical data.
This definition applies to conversations and communications outside of Operation Code.
It also applies to Operation Code’s internal operations. E.g., private donor information,
volunteer and staff records and organization trade secrets may not be shared with the 
general membership. Furthermore, such information should not be shared with others unless 
there is a specific reason to do so, as with the following illustrative examples:
● A donor profile is reviewed during a donor strategy meeting involving a board
member, fundraising staff and the CEO. Afterwards, copies of the donor profile
are collected and destroyed, except for the copy associated with the donor’s
CRM record.
● A committee is reviewing award amounts for new scholarships. Committee
members have signed the confidentiality policy, and never say a word to anyone
about who was awarded what amount--and document copies are collected and
destroyed. Award history and other personal information is accessible only to
staff with direct responsibility for the program.
● A mentor and mentee carry out private conversations using Operation Code
hosted technology. These conversations remain private unless both parties agree
to share.
● The CEO’s performance review is conducted by the Board. Written review
material is reviewed by the Board, and afterwards destroyed, although copies are
kept by the Chair and in organization files.

3. Individual Responsibility: Board members, volunteers and employees are cautioned to
demonstrate professionalism, good judgment, and care to avoid unauthorized or
inadvertent disclosures of confidential information and should, for example, refrain from
leaving confidential information contained in documents or on computer screens in plain
view.
Upon separation of employment and at the end of a volunteer’s or board member’s term,
he or she shall return, all documents, papers, and other materials, that may contain
confidential information.
Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action. This policy is intended to
protect you as well as Operation Code because in extreme cases, violations of this
policy also may result in personal liability.
4. Exceptions: This policy is not intended to prevent disclosure where disclosure is required
by law.

Procedures
1. On an annual basis, all board members, key volunteers associated with board
committees, paid and unpaid staff, and chapter volunteers shall adhere are required to:
a. Review this policy.
b. Certify their commitment to adhering to the policy.
